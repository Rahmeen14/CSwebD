      <img style="width: 100%; height: 250px" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*mjepGaO4srYed1wKcYLoTw.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>It’s the dreaded time of the year again — when I go back to school, and some guy I really respect casually mentions how I got my tech internship because I’m a girl. Or when career fair time rolls around and recruiters take one look at my face and hand me a different flyer that advertises their diversity program. Or when some talented male freshman who has been programming since he was 10 scoffs that he can’t get an internship at Google or Facebook, saying “[he] could have easily gotten it if [he] was a girl.”</p>
<p>I’m grateful for for the opportunities I receive, but I can’t help feeling bummed when I hear these comments. As a diversity program participant, I know it sucks to feel like a pawn in the game of affirmative action, sacrificing my feelings for future women in tech to enter a level playing field. Get over it! Many of my female mentors and role models have advised. You’re qualified! You’re smart! And you did a “real” software engineering internship at Facebook!</p>
<p>But hearing this does not fix the problem. As an underclassman female CS major, once the first few guys doubted my technical qualifications, I began to wonder if all my male friends felt the same way. Maybe they didn’t voice it out loud because they wanted to be tactful. There weren’t any older female CS majors that I could talk to about how I felt — mainly because these diversity programs are so new, and my class is one of the first few waves of diversity program participants.</p>
<p>I’m grateful that I have a lot of close male friends who support me as a woman. But every time I hear some insensitive comment from someone else about diversity programs during recruiting season, here’s the two-sided dialogue that goes through my head, as I contemplate what to say to fight centuries of sexism.</p>
<p>He’s probably right. Even if guys are nice and smart, they don’t get internships at large companies after freshman year.</p>
<p>Wrong! By being a woman and minority in tech, you’ve probably had to overcome so many more obstacles, like stereotype threat, to get to this same place that he has. Just by showing up to the career fair, you’ve challenged the stereotype of a CS student. By taking CS classes, you’ve gone outside of your comfort zone to pursue a field that has few role models that look like you. That guy who made the comment feels entitled to an internship, while you feel like you’re not good enough. That speaks for itself.</p>
<p>I’m not as technically qualified for an internship as he is.</p>
<p>A little-known secret: the core CS class sequence at many schools is way more than enough for several upperclassman internships. Freshman and sophomore programs assume only a few CS classes. After a certain level, additional knowledge isn’t required. Reality is, you are way more qualified for the position than you think. And the fact that you’re different is a bonus — by hiring you, companies get a maximally different perspective.</p>
<p>I don’t even know if I like CS; how do I deserve this more than him?</p>
<p>Who knows who deserves the position more. Does it matter? Statistically, he is more likely to complete the CS major and get a full-time software engineering offer, regardless of how many internships he has done. Women on the other hand drop out of CS because they don’t have many relatable role models or a strong sense of community like majority of men do. An internship is more likely to help you decide whether you like it or not so you can see yourself as a full-time software engineer. You deserve this chance.</p>
<p>Everyone will continue to look at me as a “diversity hire,” even later on.</p>
<p>When I showed up to Facebook, a lot of people outside my team asked me if I participated in Facebook’s diversity program, FBU. Maybe they had never seen a rising junior female software engineering intern who didn’t participate in FBU. But we’re clearly technically qualified, because we successfully work on impactful projects.</p>
<p>Did I actually get this because I’m a girl?</p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-family: 'Rye', cursive; color: white " >The struggle.</h3>
    <p>This is what shaped me into who I am today. I’ve been the breadwinner at home from a young age, having to juggle between university and working full-time for many years. This experience helped me develop an incredible grit and desire to move forward with my life, not only for me but for my family.</p>
<p>This has given me an impeccable work ethic, desire to learn and resourcefulness, qualities that companies (especially big ones) value very much.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-family: 'Rye', cursive; color: white ">The internship.</h3>
<p>You can’t expect to start your career at the top. One of my first tasks as an intern was to translate PowerPoint presentations from English to Spanish.
Nonetheless, this experience humbled me and I learned to live by feedback, this is actually what let me stay for longer after my contract was expired. I was constantly asking for questions, feedback and connecting with my peers.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; font-family: 'Rye', cursive; color: white ">The Learning Curve</h3>
<p>
  Being a minority in tech (20 year old woman) proved to be an incredibly steep learning curve for me. There were times in which I went home questioning myself, if this is what I really wanted. Of course it is! My life motto is to prove the world wrong. Beat the statistics.
  But of course this wasn’t easy. I was the youngest in my team and I was always being second guessed by my older, more experienced peers. I, in turn, made sure to learn and prepare myself as much as possible and although I’ve never been able to get on their level (realistically) at least I earned their respect.
</p>
<p><strong>If I could give one piece of advice to upcoming interns (and especially girls) that want to enter the tech industry is: get an internship and be mentally prepared to struggle.c</strong></p>
<p><em>It’s going to feel unbearable at times, but it’s incredibly rewarding. You’ll change and grow not only professionally but personally as well. You just have to be open to it.</em></p>
